This repository is a guide to using Webstorm, Git, and GitHub on a Windows machine.

**Github** is a good thing to know how to use because it keeps track of changes to code and allows multiple people to work on the same documents within a project at a time. If something goes wrong while editing a document, you can revert to a previous version.
